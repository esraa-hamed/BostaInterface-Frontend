# BostaInterface-Frontend

*Notes (How to run)*
- Open folder in vs code
- Open a new terminal
- npm install
- npm start

*Notes (Responsiveness)*
- The website is not completely responsive, as the time was tight and I was trying to finish all the functional requirements. However, I used to design websites to be responsive so I can make this one responsive too. You can give me extra time if you would like to see it responsive, but I am going to leave it as it is right now to stick to the deadline (before 12 am).

*Notes (Hard coded states)*
- Some things were not very clear considering the GET request. For example, I could not find the address in the json data (as Nasr City in the screenshots). So, I set the address state to 'Nasr City' because I could not find from where should I get it. Also, I did the same thing considering the delivery address and the shipper name.
