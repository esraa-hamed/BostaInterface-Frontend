# BostaInterface-Frontend

*Notes (How to run)*
- Open folder in vs code
- Open a new terminal
- npm install
- npm start

*Notes (Responsiveness)*
- The website is not completely responsive, as the time was tight and I was trying to finish all the functional requirements. However, I used to design websites to be responsive so I can make this one responsive too. You can give me extra time if you would like to see it responsive, but I am going to leave it as it is right now to stick to the deadline (before 12 am).

*Notes (Hard-coded states)*
- Some things were not very clear considering the GET request. For example, I could not find the address in the json data (as Nasr City in the screenshots). So, I set the address state to 'Nasr City' because I could not find from where should I get it. Also, I did the same thing considering the delivery address and the shipper name.

*Notes (Screen recording Video)*
- I added a screen recording video showing how the the application should be running. So if it is not running as shown in the video, then this means there may be a problem with the packages or the connection (if there is a problem with the GET request). 

*Notes (Interface screenshots)*
- I added some screenshots in the "InterfaceScreenshots" folder showing the stepper component in different states. The name of the photo implies the state.
